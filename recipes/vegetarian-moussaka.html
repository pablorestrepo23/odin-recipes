<h3>Moussaka is a recipe of purely Greek origin, although it also exists, with some variations in its ingredients and preparation, in some countries of the Balkan area and the Middle East. This dish consists, in its original form, of two main ingredients that stand out from the rest, minced lamb meat and eggplants but, for this occasion, we will make a vegetarian variation of it.</h3>

<h3>Our recipe is designed so that once finished, we have on our table a hearty casserole formed from layers of roasted eggplants and zucchini, a sauce with tomato paste, red lentils and vegetables, a touch of ground cinnamon and a creamy bechamel sauce.</h3>

<ul>
    <li>3 large eggplants (about 2 kilos)</li>

    <li>1/2 cup (about 100 grams) grated Kefalotyri, Kasseri, Pecorino Romano, or Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<ol>
<li><h4>Prepare the eggplant and zucchini</h4></li>

    <p>Trim and discard the stems from the eggplants and cut them lengthwise into 1 centimeter slices. Place the slices, without overlapping, on a baking sheet brushed all over with a little oil. Trim the stems and opposite ends of the zucchini and repeat the cutting procedure for the eggplants (try to make them the same size as the first ones). Transfer to an oiled baking sheet and set aside for later.</p>

    <br>

<li><h4>Preheat the oven</h4></li>

    <p>Line the trays containing the eggplant and zucchini with aluminum foil and preheat the oven to 200 Celsius for 30 minutes.  After the preheating time, place the eggplant and zucchini trays in the oven for 30 minutes to cook and soften them.</p>

    <br>

<li><h4>Roast the vegetables</h4></li>

    <p>Using a pastry brush, brush 1/4 cup olive oil on both sides of the eggplant and zucchini and sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt evenly over the vegetables. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown, remove from oven and let cool in pans.</p>
    
<br>

<li><h4>Make the tomato sauce</h4></li>

    <p>In a large saucepan, over medium heat, heat a three tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the onions and salt and stir occasionally until golden brown. Add the garlic, ground cinnamon and oregano and stir to cook evenly. Add the wine and cook for 3 minutes, until reduced by half. Stir in the crushed tomatoes and lentils and simmer, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender and the sauce thickens. You may need to add water as the lentils cook and soften and if the tomato sauce seems too dry.</p>

<br>

<li><h4>Make the bechamel</h4></li>

<p>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. The mixture should bubble but not brown. While continuing to whisk, slowly add 1/2 cup of milk. When fully incorporated, add the rest of the milk, 1/4 cup at a time. Whisk after each addition until smooth. Reduce heat if it starts to thicken too quickly or burns. Bring the bechamel sauce to a boil for 2 minutes while continuing to whisk. It should have the consistency of thick cream. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste.</p>

<br>

<li><h4>Temper the eggs and add cheese</h4></li>

    <p>In a large bowl, beat the eggs until frothy and add 1/2 cup of the hot bechamel sauce, about 1 tablespoon at a time while whisking. Slowly stir in the rest of the bechamel sauce. Add 1/2 cup cheese and salt to taste.</p>

<br>

<li><h4>Assemble the moussaka</h4></li>

    <p>In a large pan, add a generous drizzle of olive oil and spread it over the entire surface, sprinkle breadcrumbs evenly over the bottom of the pan. Distribute the eggplant slices and then the zucchini slices in an even layer over the breadcrumbs. Spoon tomato sauce over the top. Repeat the layers of zucchini and eggplant until they are used up. Sprinkle fresh oregano over the top and spread the remaining tomato sauce. Spread the cheese bechamel on top and sprinkle with a few more tablespoons of bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of cheese.</p>

<br>

<li><h4>Bake the moussaka</h4></li>

   <p> Line the tray with the Moussaka with aluminum foil. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until the top is golden and the edges are bubbling. Check, with the help of a knife, if it is cooked; if not, cover it again with aluminum foil and bake until it is. When it is cooked, remove the aluminum foil and let the surface brown to your liking.</p>
    

<br>

<li><h4>Serve</h4></li>

    <p>Remove the moussaka from the oven and sprinkle with parsley. Let it rest on the baking tray for 10 to 15 minutes. Cut into squares and serve.</p>

<h3>Margherita pizza is undoubtedly the most faithful manifestation of the appeal of Italian cuisine and its quality. For many Italians the margherita pizza is an example that evokes the simplicity of its art and majesty of its forms, however its legacy goes far beyond being linked to Queen Margherita of Savoy, as many popular versions have conveyed for many years.</h3>

<h3>The margherita pizza is a simple recipe, it is the typical Napolitan pizza, which is made with tomato, mozzarella (traditionally Fior di latte is used), fresh basil, salt and oil. However, despite its simplicity, this pizza is a favorite among Italians and in the whole world.</h3>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>

    <li>220 grams Italian pizza dough</li>
    <li>90 grams mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>100 grams crushed natural tomato sauce</li>
    <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    <li>A pinch of freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>

</ul>

<br>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<ol>

    <li><h4>Mixing the dough</h4></li>

        <p>In a large bowl we introduce part of the wheat flour. We leave about 4 tablespoons of flour separated to fatten the dough. With a spoon we make a hole in the center of the bowl and add the yeast dissolved in water. We beat with a wooden spoon from the center outwards and we mix little by little with the flour. Add the extra virgin olive oil and salt. It is important that the salt and the yeast do not come into direct contact so as not to have problems in the fermentation process.</p>
        <p>We continue stirring what begins to be the dough, by now it will be a sticky but firm mixture.</p>

        <br>

    <li><h4>Pizza dough kneading</h4></li>

        <p>We fill the area of the worktop with flour, take the dough out of the bowl and start working the dough with our hands. It is very important to refine the dough to make it more elastic and rise better. To refine it, we must stretch the dough like a churro and twist it in a spiral several times. At the end we put it back together and knead it again for about ten minutes. This is the trick that makes the dough amazing. After those 10 minutes, we will be able to manipulate the dough more quickly, it will become elastic and homogeneous. While kneading you can add (if you are an expert you don't need to) a little more flour than we have reserved to fatten the dough, about 50 grams.</p>

        <p>The correct flour measure is "until the dough does not stick to your hands", but do not overdo it. I have put 1 kilo in the ingredients but in reality I used about 50 grams more. It all depends on the flour because they do not always come from the same grindings, nor the wheat is the same.We turn the dough into a ball. We take the previous bowl and flour it. We introduce the ball of dough in it. We cover the bowl with a cotton cloth for about 45 minutes - 1 hour. To know how long to let the dough rise, use the following trick: if we press it with a finger and the dough returns to its original position, it will be ready to prepare.</p>

        <br>

    <li><h4>Oven preparation</h4></li>

        <p>Once we have the pizza dough ready, the first thing we do is turn on the oven. To full, the maximum of your oven. In my case at 250 Celsius for about 10 minutes and that is hot at the time of introducing the pizza. As the temperature has to be high, it can take 10 or 15 minutes. It will be the recommended time we need to assemble the pizza.</p>

        <p>We put a bowl (suitable for oven) with water, so that it has some moisture when we go to bake it. Once we have the pizza dough ready, already spread on baking paper, we prepare the filling.</p>

        <br>
    
    <li><h4>Preparation of tomato paste</h4></li>

        <p>If we do not have natural crushed tomato we can make it at home in a very simple way. We peel two tomatoes and cut them in half. With the help of a grater we will obtain that natural sauce that will be the base of our pizza. If we choose to grate the tomato, we have to avoid excessive liquid, so it is better to filter it to remove water, the more the better.</p>

        <p>We add a little salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add 3-4 fresh basil leaves to the tomato sauce with a few drops of extra virgin olive oil. Stir to combine all the ingredients.</p>

        <br>
    
    <li><h4>Ingredients implementation</h4></li>

        <p>Spread the crushed tomato all over the surface of the dough. Being careful to leave free about 2 cm. around the perimeter of the pizza. We can help us with a spoon or ladle, or with our own hands (always clean). Cut the mozzarella cheese into thick slices and spread them over the surface of the pizza. Without loading it too much, it should not take too much quantity.</p>

        <br>
    
    <li><h4>Baking</h4></li>

        <p>Carefully put the pizza in the oven. Open and place it in the middle level, which will have a homogeneous temperature both above and below.</p>

        <p>Bake at 250 Celsius heat up-down and air for 7-8 minutes. This is enough time for the dough to be ready and the cheese to melt. Sprinkle some fresh basil leaves on top and drizzle with a small amount of extra virgin olive oil. Ready to enjoy the mother of all pizzas.</p>

<h3>Pesto is one of the most recognized Italian delicacies worldwide, and it promises to never go out of style. This classic sauce has its origins in Genova, the capital of the Liguria region in northern Italy, where it began, as its name suggests, "Pesto", derived from the word "pestare", which means to crush, grind, to carry out this process with the ingredients that to this day remain in its composition.

    We will carry out the preparation of this delight, suitable for dressing, no matter what some say, any dish you can imagine.</h3>

    <h3>Pesto is normally used in its country of origin to season and fill the different types of pasta that are part of the local cuisine. For some time now, this sauce has been used to dress risottos, breads, pizzas, and some other recipes.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese (about 60 grams)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup pine nuts</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>

        <ol>

            <li><h4>Pulse the basil and pine nuts</h4></li>
            
                <p>Place the basil leaves and pine nuts in the bowl of a food processor and pulse several times without letting the contents heat up, as this alters the flavor of the basil.</p>
            
            <br>


            <li><h4>Add the garlic and cheese</h4></li>
            
                <p>Add the garlic and Parmesan cheese and press again, being careful with the appliance's temperature.</p>
            
            <br>


            <li><h4>Slowly pour in the olive oil</h4></li>
            
               <p>While the food processor is running, slowly add the olive oil in a small, steady stream; this will help emulsify it and prevent the oil from separating. Occasionally, stop to check the temperature and incorporate all the ingredients into the mixture.</p>
            
            <br>


            <li><h4>Season the pesto sauce</h4></li>
            
                <p>Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</p>
            

        </ol>
